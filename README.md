# HelloWorldIndex
An Ossn component showing how to replace the default index page

This is basically a copy of the HelloWorld component which additionally shows:

* how to address and load a separate page (file of php/html code)
* how to make this page the new default index page of your community.
* how to unregister an Ossn default action and register your own action instead
